# Finance_and_Risk_Analysis
### The wealth management industry has grown as individuals and businesses seek maximum returns but often lack the expertise or time to identify optimal investment opportunities. Portfolio managers fill this gap by making investment decisions aligned with investor goals, analyzing market trends, and optimizing portfolios.
### In this case, as an associate at an investment firm, your role is to advise two clients, Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger, based on their distinct financial goals. You’ll analyze 24 stocks from NYSE-listed companies across Technology, Travel, Banking, and Pharmaceuticals, covering data from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2020. Available metrics include daily opening and closing prices, highs and lows, adjusted close prices, and trading volumes. The S&P 500 index is also provided as a benchmark to compare overall market trends.
### Key tasks involve performing technical analysis to gauge stock trends, assessing risk-return metrics to determine suitability for each investor, and using visual comparisons to evaluate stock performance. Based on this analysis, you’ll construct tailored portfolios for each client, and by applying active investment strategies, you’ll forecast potential future returns, ensuring the portfolios align with each investor's objectives.
